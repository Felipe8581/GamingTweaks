# Fr33thy is a scammer, stop giving money to a guy who claims support tech but is on his third personal main motherboard because he cant overclock properly<br/>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZDFHUmM4ts3NpLM3jwv_pcPQbPtivDNBc9__J7FqEn4/edit#<br/>
Thats a link with evidences of how bad freethy person is..and he didnt started or made anything for tweaking scene, just a bad old guide that people made a lot of better ones later..Even danske with idk 13 year old ? made a way more complete guide..<br/>
I once was a member of his discord, like 90% of persons i know today, and EVERY single person say he is a retard.<br/>
I never, ever said bad against him till now, i even defended him at start of everyone shitting on him. Because i think if the support tech is trading time and effort for helping people it should be a respectable job. But he lies, he steals, he talk shit, and he will fuck you for money..<br/>
Im just writing this because recently he said im a douchbag and i copied his guide blablabla. Come on, i got better person to copy from.. like calypto,melody and revi guys.. Fr33thy is at very newbie level.. He cant even overclock without fry motherboards..<br/>
For the "i dont care about drama, i just wanna help at my pc and im rich", listen, he will somehow fuck you. trust me.

## Custom ISOs
This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Choose your ISO wisely. Removing/stripping too much cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust those ISO community creators because they have much experience

## Windows Timers

Windows timers are not a complex topic. Its just that we saw the options and we are complicating using bad values<br/>
The best scenario is to not use syntetic timers, which is default<br/>
To undo a command in bcdedit, do bcdedit /deletevalue X (where X is useplatformclock, x2apicpolicy, etc.)

bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes (Windows 8+) <br/>
This command forces the kernel timer to constantly poll for interrupts instead of wait for them; dynamic tick was implemented as a power saving feature for laptops but hurts desktop performance

bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes (Windows 8+) <br/>
Forces the clock to be backed by a platform source, no synthetic timers are allowed <br/>
Potentially better performance, lowers timer resolution to .488 instead of .5ms

**Time Stamp Counter** (TSC) (default) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock false) <br/>
TSC is reliable and will give you the lowest latency and highest fps<br/>

**ACPI Power Management Timer** (PMT) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock true + HPET BIOS OFF) <br/>
PMT is a highly stable high frequency clock, it doesn't sync, because it is not set to a fixed heartbeat. It is frequency based, which means that it will never delay another tick from happening. This can eliminate the chance of having stutters.

**High Precision Event Timer** (HPET) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock true + HPET BIOS ON)<br/>
HPET is highly stable high frequency clock, but it is programmed to be synced tightly, since it is set to tick every x amount of time, regardless of hardware configuration
HPET would be good if all cores ticked at the exact same speed and were naturally synced, but that is something that rarely ever happens which is why it is bad
HPET is a hardware based, synthetic timer, windows made it for debugging purposes and most of the time almost everytime it shouldnt be used
High frequency clocks like HPET may potentially allow for smoother gameplay and better sync at the expense of latency<br/>

Different Windows versions (7/8/8.1/10) all have different ways of using the TSC <br/>
Some motherboards have no option to disable HPET, if you are advanced there is custom bios<br/>

**Note:** It will almost always(99%) be better to not use platformclock

## MSI-Mode and Affinitys

MSI is Message Signaled-Based Interrupts, a faster and better method that replaces Windows Line-Based interrupt mode<br/>
Some drivers default to using legacy pin-triggered interrupts, which are now emulated and are slower than using MSI<br/>

##  Process Scheduling

Win32PrioritySeparation value is the amount of time the Windows process scheduler allocates to a program

**42 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, High foreground boost. 2A Hex<br/>
**41 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 29 Hex<br/>
**40 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, No foreground boost. 28 Hex<br/>
**38 Decimal** = Short, Variable, High foreground boost. 26 Hex<br/>
**37 Decimal** = Short, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 25 Hex<br/>
**36 Decimal** = Short, Variable, No foreground boost. 24 Hex<br/>
**26 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, High foreground boost. 1A Hex<br/>
**25 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 19 Hex<br/>
**24 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, No foreground boost. 18 Hex<br/>
**22 Decimal** = Long, Variable, High foreground boost. 16 Hex<br/>
**21 Decimal** = Long, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 15 Hex<br/>
**20 Decimal** = Long, Variable, No foreground boost. 14 Hex<br/>

![w](/img/w32.png)

**To set Win32PrioritySeparation to 38 Decimal (26 Hex), paste this to Command Promt:**

`REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\PriorityControl" /v "Win32PrioritySeparation" /t REG_DWORD /d "38" /f`

##  Power Options

If you are in windows 8 or 10 just tweak your BIOS disabling c-states and power savings so you can disable Power service in windows with:<br/>
REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Power" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "4" /f

What it does: Disable wake timers, USB Suspend setting, Controls CPU Idle, Disable Power Savings, Unpark cores and more. <br/>

Drop the file in C:/, Open command promt and type: <br/>
powercfg -import C:/RevisionPowerPlanV2.8.pow <br/>
Open Power Options and select RevisionPowerPlanV2.8 <br/>

[Download RevisionPowerPlanV2.8.pow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OvMwK7XD_e93hkGoyuQV-WuHsylvZgUf/view?usp=sharing)

Enable idle: (less responsive, lowers temperature)<br/>
powercfg -setacvalueindex scheme_current sub_processor 5d76a2ca-e8c0-402f-a133-2158492d58ad 0<br/>
powercfg -setactive scheme_current<br/>
Disable idle: (more responsive, raises temperature)<br/>
powercfg -setacvalueindex scheme_current sub_processor 5d76a2ca-e8c0-402f-a133-2158492d58ad 1<br/>
powercfg -setactive scheme_current


###  Device Clean Up Tool

This is a usefull utility to remove detached/ghost devices, very safe to do.

##   Services

You should learn what services to disable, use regedit/serviwin, remove the necessary dependencys<br/>
DONT disable what doesnt have cpu cycles, install processexplorer or processhacker and you will see there is no point on disabling many services<br/>
If you are on decent windows like Revision isos, you really dont need that extra 1%, having fewer threads/processes is not big gains.

##   BIOS

This is very important for your system, make sure to check every setting <br/>

**Must do:**

Disable C-State (CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E), C3, C6, C7, C8)<br/>
Disable Intel (R) Speed Shift Technology<br/> or CPU Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) Function<br/>
Disable Active State Power Management ASPM/ALPM settings<br/>
Disable OnBoard Video, Audio or Lan Controller if you have a PCI/USB one that is or will be installed.<br/>
Disable Platform Power Management<br/>
Disable any onboard LED traces/lights<br/>
Disable not used features<br/>
Enable XMP

**Remove all protections and power savings, enable max performance/power** <br/>
