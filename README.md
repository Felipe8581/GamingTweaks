I even defended him when everyone was shitting on him. Because I think if the support tech is trading time and 
effort for helping people it should be a respectable job.<br/>
But he lies, he steals, he talk shit, and he will fuck you for money..<br/>

Tweaking improves latency, input lag, system responsiveness, not FPS. You can improve min and lows frametimes, 
depending on your hardware but do not expect your computer to suddenly start hitting higher fps<br/>
This is not realistic and that's why it's called optimization, not a miracle<br/>
"If you want more FPS, buy a new one PC with better hardware."<br/>

A common misunderstanding - LatencyMon and how the scores "don't matter"<br/>

Latencymon is a commonly used tool by people who are interested in measuring & fixing their dpc latency, and also, <br/>
by gamers who want to achieve low system latency. Originally, latencymon was designed to just simply check if your <br/>
system is suitable for processing real-time audio. But it's nowadays even "abused" mainly by the small portion of<br/>
the gaming community who tweak their systems. Some of them think, if your average DPC latency shows low values, your<br/>
system has low latency! Yay! And, it kind of is true. But not in a way that you'd imagine it to be.<br/>

If you have the same amount of memory latency as someone else, more than likely both of your ram performs at a very <br/>
similar level, depending on the hardware of course. Many people think if they have the same amount of DPC latency <br/>
as someone else, their system will be exactly as low latency as theirs too. This is obviously not true, as something<br/>
as simple as replugging your mouse and keyboard can affect the latency of your system. Now, obviously many people <br/>
know that this isn't true, and they say "oh, don't look at latencymon lol! it's complete placebo utter garbage tool<br/>
that doesn't say anything". And this is partly true. But by ignoring stuff like DPC latency & the amount of <br/>
ISRs (interrupts) each specific driver creates, many people will still continue to have an unenjoyable gaming experience,<br/>
and they can't figure out why. Because a) they don't even fucking check the drivers tab in latencymon <br/>
b) there's something else going on that's not related to DPCs and ISRs (listed below).<br/>

- Bad SSD (eg. Kingston A400)<br/>
- Bad RAM w/o tightened timings<br/>
- Bad / no cooling (eg. no RAM / VRM cooling)<br/>
- Too low voltage<br/>
- Untweaked UEFI aka BIOS<br/>
- No proper knowledge about hardware dependant settings (eg. Shader Cache & Large System Cache)<br/>
- Bad PSU / power / bad or no grounding<br/>
- Bad cables (eg. monitor & ethernet cable)<br/>
- Bad network (eg. incorrectly configured network settings, bad modem/router, bad isp & bad routing)<br/>
- Interference caused by modem / router, phone, etc.<br/>
- CR2 instead of CR1<br/>
- And much more<br/>

In my opinion latencymon shouldn't be used at all, especially by the tweaking communities. Maybe by the ones who have an IQ <br/>
of over 30 and know how to use it. Not by the people who got pointed in the wrong direction. You may ask why. Well, because <br/>
latencymon's own driver (rspLLL.sys / rspLLL64.sys) that's used to measure hard page faults, DPCs and ISRs, creates <br/>
a shit ton amount of DPCs. Like legitimately 1000 times more DPCs than for example ndis.sys (which is responsible for network) <br/>
in my case. And, what do people in tweaking communities do when using latencymon? They look at the average dpc latency. <br/>
Also, the tool is really inconsistent, which bring us to the glorious tool that is superior to latencymon: xperf. It's by <br/>
microsoft itself and is included with the Windows Performance Toolkit. The usage of xperf is really simple, and is done using <br/>
command prompt. A simple guide written by mbk1969 shows how to use xperf to trace DPCs and ISRs <br/>
(https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/simple-way-to-trace-dpcs-and-isrs.423884/). <br/>
Also the report that xperf creates is a lot more detailed than the one which latencymon creates, which makes xperf the superior<br/>
tool to analyze DPCs and ISRs and the potential problems caused by them. <br/>

Conclusion: Take a look at your current system configuration and try to comprehend what might be causing potential problems, <br/>
if you have any. Latencymon nor xperf can't tell everything. Thank you. <br/>

## What is Revision Custom ISO Windows
Choose your ISO wisely. This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Removing/stripping too much<br/>
cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust that specific<br/>
ISO community because they have much experience<br/>

[*Learn more about them in Revision discord*](https://discordapp.com/invite/CCxWegZ)<br/>
[Get your Revision windows here](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download) <br/>

## Things that you shouldnt forget

**Disable C-State (CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E), C3, C6, C7, C8)**<br/>
**Disable Intel (R) Speed Shift Technology<br/> or CPU Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) Function**<br/>
**Enable XMP**<br/>

Obviously disable every single power saving feature and try go for max performance/stability<br/>
