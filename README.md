I even defended him when everyone was shitting on him. Because I think if the support tech is trading time and 
effort for helping people it should be a respectable job.<br/>
But he lies, he steals, he talk shit, and he will fuck you for money.. and even usually burn hardwares<br/>

## What is Revision Custom ISO Windows
Choose your ISO wisely. This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Removing/stripping too much<br/>
cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust that specific<br/>
ISO community because they have much experience<br/>
