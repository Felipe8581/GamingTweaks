Im offering a program called FelipeTool, 

The program is designed to speed up and automate tweaking and make it easy. Everything is free information and knowledge compiled and few automatizations.
The app will help with network performance, frametimes, latency and add quality of life to tweaking and overclocking.

## What is Revision Custom ISO Windows
Choose your ISO wisely. This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Removing/stripping too much<br/>
cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust that specific<br/>
ISO community because they have much experience<br/>
