## What is Revision Custom ISO Windows
Choose your ISO wisely. This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Removing/stripping too much<br/>
cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust that specific<br/>
ISO community because they have much experience<br/>

## Things that you shouldnt forget

**Disable C-State (CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E), C3, C6, C7, C8)**<br/>
**Disable Intel (R) Speed Shift Technology<br/> or CPU Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) Function**<br/>
**Enable XMP**<br/>

Obviously disable every single power saving feature and try go for max performance/stability<br/>
