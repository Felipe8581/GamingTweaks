I even defended him when everyone was shitting on him.<br/>
Because I think if the support tech is trading time and effort for helping <br/>
people it should be a respectable job.<br/>
But he lies, he steals, he talk shit, and he will fuck you for money..<br/>

Tweaking improves latency, input lag, system responsiveness, not FPS. You can<br/>
improve min and lows frametimes, depending on your hardware but do not expect<br/>
your computer to suddenly start hitting higher fps unless you did shit before <br/>
This is not realistic and that's why it's called optimization, not a miracle<br/>
"If you want more FPS, buy a new one PC with better hardware."<br/>

A common misunderstanding - LatencyMon and how the scores "don't matter"<br/>

Latencymon is a commonly used tool by people who are interested in measuring & <br/>
fixing their dpc latency, and also, by gamers who want to achieve low system latency.<br/>
Originally, latencymon was designed to just simply check if your system is suitable<br/>
for processing real-time audio. But it's nowadays even "abused" mainly by the small<br/>
portion of the gaming community who tweak their systems. Some of them think, if <br/>
your average DPC latency shows low values, your system has low latency! Yay! And,<br/>
it kind of is true. But not in a way that you'd imagine it to be.<br/>

If you have the same amount of memory latency as someone else, more than likely both<br/>
of your ram performs at a very similar level, depending on the hardware of course. Many<br/>
people think if they have the same amount of DPC latency as someone else, their system<br/>
will be exactly as low latency as theirs too. This is obviously not true, as something<br/>
as simple as replugging your mouse and keyboard can affect the latency of your system.<br/>
Now, obviously many people know that this isn't true, and they say "oh, don't look at<br/>
latencymon lol! it's complete placebo utter garbage tool that doesn't say anything". <br/>
And this is partly true. But by ignoring stuff like DPC latency & the amount of <br/>
ISRs (interrupts) each specific driver creates, many people will still continue to <br/>
have an unenjoyable gaming experience, and they can't figure out why. <br/>
Because a) they don't even fucking check the drivers tab in latencymon <br/>
b) there's something else going on that's not related to DPCs and ISRs (listed below).<br/>

## What is Revision Custom ISO Windows
Choose your ISO wisely. This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Removing/stripping too much cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust that specific ISO community because they have much experience

## Things that you shouldnt forget

**Disable C-State (CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E), C3, C6, C7, C8)**<br/>
**Disable Intel (R) Speed Shift Technology<br/> or CPU Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) Function**<br/>
**Enable XMP**<br/>

Obviously disable every single power saving feature and try go for max performance/stability<br/>
